# Task 5 - Persistent Task Manager using File I/O ðŸ“‚

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project:
This Python program is a **File-Based Task Manager** that allows you to:
- Create new tasks
- View existing tasks
- Update tasks
- Delete tasks

Unlike the earlier in-memory CRUD application, this version **stores tasks permanently** in a text file (`tasks.txt`) inside the `File-IO-CRUD` folder.  
Even after closing the program, all tasks remain saved.

This project is part of my **Software Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.

- Python 3.x
