# Task 2 - Number Pattern Generator ðŸ”¢

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project:
This Python program generates two types of number patterns based on user input:
- **Pyramid Pattern**
- **Right-Angled Triangle Pattern**

It allows the user to:
- Enter the number of rows.
- Choose the desired pattern.
- Repeat the process multiple times.
- Exit when done.

This is part of my **Software Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**, and it helped reinforce my understanding of loops, nested conditions, and input handling in Python.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Console-based menu system
- Dynamic user input

---

## ðŸ§¾ Program Features:
- Clean and dynamic menu for user interaction
- Accepts new row value each time
- Easy-to-read pyramid and triangle number patterns
- Option to exit the program cleanly

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Program:

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Task-2-Number-Pattern
python number_pattern.py
